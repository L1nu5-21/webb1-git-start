                <h2>Big iron</h2>
                <p>
                    To the town of Agua Fria
                    Rode a stranger one fine day
                    Hardly spoke to folks around him
                    Didn't have too much to say
                    No one dared to ask his business
                    No one dared to make a slip
                    The stranger there among them
                    Had a big iron on his hip
                    Big iron on his hip
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was early in the morning
                    When he rode into the town
                    He came riding from the south side
                    Slowly looking all around
                    "He's an outlaw loose and running"
                    Came the whisper from each lip
                    "And he's here to do some business
                    With the big iron on his hip"
                    Big iron on his hip
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this town there lived an outlaw
                    By the name of Texas Red
                    Many men had tried to take him
                    And that many men were dead
                    He was vicious and a killer
                    Though a youth of twenty-four
                    And the notches on his pistol
                    Numbered one and nineteen more
                    One and nineteen more
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now the stranger started talking
                    Made it plain to folks around
                    Was an Arizona Ranger
                    Wouldn't be too long in town
                    He came here to take an outlaw
                    Back alive, or maybe dead
                    And he said it didn't matter
                    He was after Texas Red
                    After Texas Red
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wasn't long before the story
                    Was relayed to Texas Red
                    But the outlaw didn't worry
                    Men that tried before were dead
                    Twenty men had tried to take him
                    Twenty men had made a slip
                    Twenty-one would be the Ranger
                    With the big iron on his hip
                    Big iron on his hip
                </p>

                <p>
                    The morning passed so quickly
                    It was time for them to meet
                    It was twenty past eleven
                    When they walked out in the street
                    Folks were watching from the windows
                    Everybody held their breath
                    They knew this handsome Ranger
                    Was about to meet his death
                    'Bout to meet his death
                </p>

                <p>
                    There was forty feet between them
                    When they stopped to make their play
                    And the swiftness of the Ranger
                    Is still talked about today
                    Texas Red had not cleared leather
                    'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
                    And the Ranger's aim was deadly
                    With the big iron on his hip
                    Big iron on his hip
                </p>
